# Figment Pixel Color Counter

## !!FORK UPDATE!! Hybrid Color Weighting For Anti-aliasing (edits in get_color_weights() in main.py)

The original script had each pixel operating under a sort of "winner takes all" system, where a given anti-aliasing pixel would assume full pigment of its closest color based on the euclidean distance in RGB space.

This update handles anti-aliasing pixels by representing them more accurately with the specific breakdown of colors each pixel is composed of. For example for a pixel that is 60% pink, 30% blue, 10% white, it would be represented with this breakdown rather than assuing 100% pink.

How this actually happens:
#### 1. Compute distances in RGB space
For each pixel’s RGB triplet, the script calculates its squared Euclidean distance to every target color in the palette:
d = (R - Rᵢ)² + (G - Gᵢ)² + (B - Bᵢ)²
#### 2. Invert distances to derive contribution weights
Each distance is inverted so that closer colors produce larger values:
wᵢ = 1 / (dᵢ + ε)
#### 3. Normalize weights into percentages
All weights are divided by their sum so they form a distribution that adds up to 1.0, effectively turning proximity into fractional color ownership:
#### 4. Apply percentages to pixel counts
The resulting proportions are multiplied by how many times that RGB value occurs in the image, incrementally building totals for each target color based on partial rather than absolute membership.

## !!END FORK UPDATE!!

A Python tool for calculating the exact percentage of specific colors in images. This tool was developed for the tabletop game [Figment](https://www.cmyk.games/products/figment), where players guess the percentage of different colors on cards featuring abstract designs.

## Background

Figment is a game about visual perception where players try to guess what percentage of a card is covered by four specific colors: pink, green, blue, and silver. To create the game, we needed a precise way to calculate these percentages for scoring.

This tool converts high-resolution PNG images to pixel data, and then maps each pixel to the closest color in our defined palette using Euclidean distance in RGB space. It then calculates the exact percentage of each target color.

## Features

- Process entire directories of PNG images
- Map millions of unique pixel colors to specific target colors
- Calculate precise color percentages to six decimal places
- Handle edge aliasing and color blending
- Output results in CSV format for analysis
- Progress bar for monitoring batch operations

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/figment-pixel-counter.git
cd figment-pixel-counter
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install pillow numpy webcolors tqdm
```

## Usage

1. Place your PNG images in a directory (default is `./images/`)

2. Edit the configuration section of `batch_open_source.py` if needed:
```python
# Directory containing PNG files
directory_path = './images/'

# Output CSV file path
output_csv = 'color_analysis.csv'

# Define target colors as {name: RGB tuple}
target_colors = {
    'hotpink': webcolors.hex_to_rgb('#ff69b4'),  
    'darkcyan': webcolors.hex_to_rgb('#008b8b'),
    'lightgray': webcolors.hex_to_rgb('#d3d3d3'),
    'blue': webcolors.hex_to_rgb('#005DBA'),
    'white': webcolors.hex_to_rgb('#ffffff')
}
```

3. Run the script:
```
python batch_open_source.py
```

4. Review the results in the generated CSV file

## How It Works

The algorithm works through these steps:

1. Load each PNG image and convert to an RGB array
2. Find all unique colors and their pixel counts
3. Map each unique color to its closest target color using Euclidean distance
4. Calculate percentages based on total pixel count
5. Output results to CSV with both percentages and raw pixel counts

## Example Output

The CSV output includes:
- Filename
- Percentage columns for each target color
- Raw pixel count columns for each target color

```
Filename,hotpink_percent,darkcyan_percent,lightgray_percent,blue_percent,white_percent,hotpink,darkcyan,lightgray,blue,white
card001.png,0.331542,0.253896,0.119871,0.294691,0.000000,78412,60034,28337,69687,0
card002.png,0.247105,0.247105,0.228895,0.276895,0.000000,58421,58421,54123,65445,0
...
```

## Customization

You can adjust this tool for your own needs:

- **Different Colors**: Update the `target_colors` dictionary with your own RGB values
- **Different File Types**: Modify the file filtering in `process_directory()` to accept other image formats
- **Precision**: Change the format string in `analyze_image_colors()` to adjust decimal precision
